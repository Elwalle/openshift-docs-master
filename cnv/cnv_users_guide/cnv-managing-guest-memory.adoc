If you want to adjust guest memory settings to suit a specific use case, you can
do so by editing the guest's YAML configuration file. {CNVProductNameStart} allows you
to configure guest memory overcommitment and disable guest memory overhead
accounting.

Both of these procedures carry some degree of risk. Proceed only if you are
an experienced administrator.
