As a cluster administrator, you can configure OpenShift Software Defined Network
(SDN) to assign one or more egress IP addresses to a project. All outgoing
external connections from the specified project will share the same, fixed
source IP, allowing external resources to recognize the traffic based
on the egress IP. An egress IP address assigned to a project is different from
the egress router, which is used to send traffic to specific destinations.

Egress IPs are implemented as additional IP addresses on the primary network
interface of the node and must be in the same subnet as the node's primary IP.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Egress IPs must not be configured in any Linux network configuration files, such
as `ifcfg-eth0`.

Allowing additional IP addresses on the primary network interface might require
extra configuration when using some cloud or VM solutions.

You can assign egress IP addresses to namespaces by setting the `egressIPs`
parameter of the `NetNamespace` resource. After an egress IP is associated with
a project, OpenShift SDN allows you to assign egress IPs to hosts in two ways:

* In the _automatically assigned_ approach, an egress IP address range is
assigned to a node. You set the `egressCIDRs` parameter of each node's
`HostSubnet` resource to indicate the range of egress IP addresses that can be
hosted by a node. This is the preferred approach.
* In the _manually assigned_ approach, a list of one or more egress IP address
is assigned to a node. You set the `egressIPs` parameter of each node's
`HostSubnet` resource to indicate the IP addresses that can be hosted by a node.

Namespaces that request an egress IP addresses are matched with nodes that are
able to host those egress IP addresses, and then the egress IP addresses are
assigned to those nodes.  If `egressIPs` is set on a `NetNamespace` resource,
but no node hosts that egress IP address, then egress traffic from the namespace
will be dropped.

High availability of nodes is automatic. If a node that hosts egress IP
addresses is unreachable and there are nodes that are able to host those egress
IP addresses, then the egress IP addresses will move to a new node. When the
original egress IP address node comes back online, the egress IP addresses
automatically move to balance egress IP addresses across nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot use manually assigned and automatically assigned egress IP addresses
on the same nodes. If you manually assign egress IP addresses from an IP address
range, you must not make that range available for automatic IP assignment.
