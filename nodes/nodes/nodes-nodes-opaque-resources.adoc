Opaque integer resources allow cluster operators to provide new node-level
resources that would be otherwise unknown to the system. Users can consume these
resources in pod specifications, similar to CPU and memory. The scheduler performs 
resource accounting so that no more than the available amount is
simultaneously allocated to pods.

[NOTE]
====
Opaque integer resources are Alpha currently, and only resource accounting is
implemented. There is no resource quota or limit range support for these
resources, and they have no impact on QoS.
