= Connecting Knative Services to existing Kubernetes deployments

Knative Services can call a Kubernetes deployment in any namespace, provided that there are no existing additional network barriers.

A Kubernetes deployment can call a Knative Service if:

* The Kubernetes deployment is in the same namespace as the target Knative Service.
* The Kubernetes deployment is in a namespace that was manually added to the ServiceMeshMemberRoll in `knative-serving-ingress`.
* The Kubernetes deployment uses the target Knative Service's public URL.
+
[NOTE]
====
Knative Services are accessed using a public URL by default. The target Knative Service must not be configured as a private, `cluster-local` visibility service if you want to connect it to your existing Kubernetes deploying using a public URL.
