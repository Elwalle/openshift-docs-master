= Overview of the OperatorHub

The _OperatorHub_ is available via the {product-title} web console and is the
interface that cluster administrators use to discover and install Operators.
With one click, an Operator can be pulled from their off-cluster source,
installed and subscribed on the cluster, and made ready for engineering teams to
self-service manage the product across deployment environments using the
Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).

Cluster administrators can choose from OperatorSources grouped into
the following categories:
