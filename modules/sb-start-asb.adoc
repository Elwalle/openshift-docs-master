= Starting the {asb-name}

After you have installed the OpenShift Ansible Service Broker Operator, you can start the {asb-name}
using the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the service catalog.
* You have installed the OpenShift Ansible Service Broker Operator.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select the `openshift-ansible-service-broker` project.
. Select the *OpenShift Ansible Service Broker Operator*.
. Under *Provided APIs*, click *Create New* for *Automation Broker*.
. Add the following to the `spec` field in the default YAML provided:
+
[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: rhcc
    type: rhcc
    url: https://registry.redhat.io
    auth_type: secret
    auth_name: asb-registry-auth
----
+
This references the secret that was created when installing the OpenShift Ansible Service Broker Operator, which allows you to connect to the Red Hat Container Catalog.
. Set any additional {asb-name} configuration options and click *Create*.
. Verify that the {asb-name} has started.
+
After the {asb-name} has started, you can view the available service bundles by
navigating to *Catalog* -> *Developer Catalog* and selecting the *Service Class*
checkbox. Note that it may take a few minutes for the {asb-name} to start and
the service bundles to be available.
+
If you do not yet see these Service classes, you can check the status of the
following items:

* {asb-name} Pod status
** From the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page for the *openshift-ansible-service-broker* project,
verify that the Pod that starts with `asb-` has a status of *Running* and
readiness of *Ready*.

* Cluster service broker status
** From the *Catalog* -> *Broker Management* -> *Service Brokers* page, verify
that the *ansible-service-broker* service broker has a status of *Ready*.

* Service catalog controller manager Pod logs
** From the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page for the
*openshift-service-catalog-controller-manager* project, review the logs for
each of the Pods and verify that you see a log entry with the message
`Successfully fetched catalog entries from broker`.
