[id="nw-networkpolicy-multitenant-isolation_{context}"]
= Configuring multitenant isolation using NetworkPolicy

You can configure your project to isolate it from Pods and Services in other
projects.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster using the OpenShift SDN network plug-in with `mode: NetworkPolicy`
set. This mode is the default for OpenShift SDN.
* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the following files containing NetworkPolicy object definitions:
.. A file named `allow-from-openshift-ingress.yaml` containing the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----

.. A file named `allow-from-openshift-monitoring.yaml` containing the
following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-monitoring
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: monitoring
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----

. For each policy file, run the following command to create the NetworkPolicy
object:
+
----
$ oc apply -f <policy-name>.yaml \ <1>
  -n <project> <2>
----
<1> Replace `<policy-name>` with the filename of the file containing the policy.
<2> Replace `<project>` with the name of the project to apply the NetworkPolicy
object to.

. Optional: Confirm that the NetworkPolicy object exists in your current project
by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc get networkpolicy <policy-name> -o yaml
----
+
In the following example, the `allow-from-openshift-ingress` NetworkPolicy
object is displayed:
+
----
$ oc get networkpolicy allow-from-openshift-ingress -o yaml

apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
  namespace: project1
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
----
