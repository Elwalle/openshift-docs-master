= Configuring monitoring for the {asb-name}

In order for Prometheus to monitor the {asb-name}, you must create the following resources to grant Prometheus permission to access the namespace where the {asb-name} was installed.

.Prerequisites

* The OpenShift Ansible Broker is installed.
+
[NOTE]
====
This procedure assumes that you installed the {asb-name} into the `openshift-ansible-service-broker` namespace.
====

.Procedure

. Create the role.
.. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Roles* and click *Create Role*.

.. Replace the YAML in the editor with the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: prometheus-k8s
  namespace: openshift-ansible-service-broker
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - services
  - endpoints
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
----
.. Click *Create*.

. Create the role binding.
.. Navigate to *Administration* -> *Role Bindings* and click *Create Binding*.
.. For the *Binding Type*, select *Namespace Role Binding (RoleBinding)*.
.. For the *Role Binding*, enter `prometheus-k8s` in the *Name* field and `openshift-ansible-service-broker` in the *Namespace* field.
.. For the *Role*, select *prometheus-k8s*.
.. For the *Subject*, choose the *Service Account* option, select the
 `openshift-monitoring` namespace, and enter `prometheus-k8s` in the
 *Subject Name* field.
.. Click *Create*.

Prometheus will now have access to {asb-name} metrics.
