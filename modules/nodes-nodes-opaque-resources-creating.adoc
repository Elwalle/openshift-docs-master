= Creating Opaque Integer Resources

There are two steps required to use opaque integer resources. First, the cluster
operator must name and advertise a per-node opaque resource on one or more nodes. Second,
application developer must request the opaque resource in pods.

To make opaque integer resources available:

.Procedure

. Allocate the resource and assign a name starting with `pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/opaque-int-resource-`

. Advertise a new opaque integer resource by submitting
a PATCH HTTP request to the API server that specifies the available
quantity in the `status.capacity` for a node in the cluster.
+
For example, the following HTTP request advertises five `foo` resources on the
`openshift-node-1` node.

----
PATCH /api/v1/nodes/openshift-node-1/status HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json-patch+json
Host: openshift-master:8080

[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/status/capacity/pod.alpha.kubernetes.io~1opaque-int-resource-foo",
    "value": "5"
  }
]

[NOTE]
====
The `~1` in the `path` is the encoding for the character `/`.
The operation path value in the JSON-Patch is interpreted as a
JSON-Pointer. For more details, refer to
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#section-3[IETF RFC 6901, section 3].
====
+
After this operation, the node `status.capacity` includes a new resource. The
`status.allocatable` field is updated automatically with the new resource
asynchronously.
+
[NOTE]
====
Since the scheduler uses the node `status.allocatable` value when evaluating pod
fitness, there might be a short delay between patching the node capacity with a
new resource and the first pod that requests the resource to be scheduled on
that node.
