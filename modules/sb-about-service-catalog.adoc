= About the service catalog

When developing microservices-based applications to run on cloud native
platforms, there are many ways to provision different resources and share their
coordinates, credentials, and configuration, depending on the service
provider and the platform.

To give developers a more seamless experience, {product-title} includes a
_service catalog_, an implementation of the
link:https://openservicebrokerapi.org/[Open Service Broker API] (OSB API) for
Kubernetes. This allows users to connect any of their applications deployed in
{product-title} to a wide variety of service brokers.

The service catalog allows cluster administrators to integrate multiple
platforms using a single API specification. The {product-title} web console
displays the cluster service classes offered by service brokers in the service
catalog, allowing users to discover and instantiate those services for use with
their applications.

As a result, service users benefit from ease and consistency of use across
different types of services from different providers, while service providers
benefit from having one integration point that gives them access to multiple
platforms.

The service catalog is not installed by default in {product-title} 4.
