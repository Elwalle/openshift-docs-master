= Knative Serving

Knative Serving on {product-title} builds on Kubernetes and Istio to support deploying and serving serverless applications.

It creates a set of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that are used to define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

These CRDs can be used as building blocks to address complex use cases, such as rapid deployment of serverless containers, automatic scaling of Pods, routing and network programming for Istio components, or viewing point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations.

== Knative Serving components

The components described in this section are the resources that Knative Serving requires to be configured and run correctly.

Knative service resource:: The `service.serving.knative.dev` resource automatically manages the whole lifecycle of a serverless workload on a cluster. It controls the creation of other objects to ensure that an app has a route, a configuration, and a new revision for each update of the service. Services can be defined to always route traffic to the latest revision or to a pinned revision.

Knative route resource:: The `route.serving.knative.dev` resource maps a network endpoint to one or more Knative revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes.

Knative configuration resource:: The `configuration.serving.knative.dev` resource maintains the required state for your deployment. Modifying a configuration creates a new revision.

Knative revision resource:: The `revision.serving.knative.dev` resource is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to the workload. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as needed.
Cluster administrators can modify the `revision.serving.knative.dev` resource to enable automatic scaling of Pods in your {product-title} cluster.
