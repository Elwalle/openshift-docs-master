= Backing up etcd data

Follow these steps to back up etcd data by creating an etcd snapshot and backing up static Kubernetes API server resources. This backup can be saved and used at a later time if you need to restore etcd.

// TODO: Need to mention that encryption keys are backed up if etcd encryption is enabled?

You should only save a backup from a single master host. You do not need a backup from each master host in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* SSH access to a master host.

.Procedure

. Access a master host as the root user.

. Run the `etcd-snapshot-backup.sh` script and pass in the location to save the backup to.

$ sudo /usr/local/bin/etcd-snapshot-backup.sh ./assets/backup

In this example, the etcd snapshot and static Kubernetes API server resources are saved to `./assets/backup/snapshot_db_kuberesources_<datetimestamp>.tar.gz` on the master host.
