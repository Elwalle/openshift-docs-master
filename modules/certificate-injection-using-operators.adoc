= Certificate injection using Operators

Once your custom CA certificate is added to the cluster via ConfigMap, the
Cluster Network Operator merges the user-provided and system CA certificates
into a single bundle and injects the merged bundle into the Operator requesting
the trust bundle injection.

Operators request this injection by creating an empty ConfigMap with the
following label:

[source,yaml]
----
config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle="true"
----

The Operator mounts this ConfigMap into the container's local trust store.

[NOTE]
====
Adding a trusted CA certificate is only needed if the certificate is not
included in the {op-system-first} trust bundle.
