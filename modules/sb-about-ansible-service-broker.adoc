= About the {asb-name}

The _{asb-name}_ is an implementation of the Open Service Broker (OSB) API that
manages applications defined by _Ansible playbook bundles_ (APBs). APBs provide
a method for defining and distributing container applications in
{product-title}, and consist of a bundle of Ansible playbooks built into a
container image with an Ansible runtime. APBs leverage Ansible to create a
standard mechanism to automate complex deployments.

The {asb-name} follows this basic workflow:

. A user requests the list of available applications from the service catalog
using the {product-title} web console.
. The service catalog requests the list of available applications from the {asb-name}.
. The {asb-name} communicates with a defined container image registry to learn
which APBs are available.
. The user issues a request to provision a specific APB.
. The {asb-name} fulfills the user's provision request by invoking the provision
method on the APB.

The {asb-name} is not installed by default in {product-title} 4.

== Ansible playbook bundles

An Ansible playbook bundle (APB) is a lightweight application definition that
allows you to leverage existing investment in Ansible roles and playbooks.

APBs use a simple directory with named playbooks to perform OSB API actions,
such as provision and bind. Metadata defined in the `apb.yml` file contains a
list of required and optional parameters for use during deployment.
