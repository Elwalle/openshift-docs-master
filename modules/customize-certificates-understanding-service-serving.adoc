= Understanding service serving certificates

Service serving certificates are intended to support complex
middleware applications that require encryption. These certificates are
issued as TLS web server certificates.

The `service-ca` controller uses the `x509.SHA256WithRSA` signature
algorithm to generate service certificates.

The generated certificate and key are in PEM format, stored in `tls.crt`
and `tls.key` respectively, within a created secret. The
certificate and key are automatically replaced when they get close to
expiration. The service CA certificate, which signs the service
certificates, is only valid for one year after {product-title} is installed.
