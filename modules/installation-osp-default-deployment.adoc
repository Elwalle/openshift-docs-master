= Resource guidelines for installing {product-title} on OpenStack

Your quota must meet the following requirements to run the {product-title} installation program in {rh-openstack-first}.

.Recommended resources for a default {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack}
[options="header"]
|================================
|Resource              | Value
|Floating IP addresses | 2
|Ports                 | 15
|Routers               | 1
|Subnets               | 1
|RAM                   | 112 GB
|vCPUs                 | 28
|Volume storage        | 175 GB
|Instances             | 7
|Security groups       | 3
|Security group rules  | 60
|Swift containers      | 2
|Swift objects         | 1
|Swift available space | 10 MB or more
|================================

[NOTE]
Swift space requirements vary depending on the size of the bootstrap Ignition file and image registry.

A cluster might function with fewer than recommended resources, but its performance is not guaranteed.

[NOTE]
By default, your security group and security group rule quotas might be low. If you encounter problems, run `openstack quota set --secgroups 3 --secgroup-rules 60 <project>` to increase them.

An {product-title} deployment comprises control plane machines, compute machines, and a bootstrap machine.
