= Understanding {product-title} upgrade channels

In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of upgrade channels for
recommending the appropriate upgrade versions to your cluster. Upgrade channels
separate upgrade strategies and also are used to control the cadence of updates.
Channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance,
{product-title} {product-version} channels will never include an upgrade to a
4.3 release. This ensures administrators make an explicit decision to upgrade to
the next minor version of {product-title}. Channels only control updates and
have no impact on the version of the cluster you install; the
`openshift-install` binary for a given patch level of {product-title} always
installs that patch level.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4495171[OpenShift 4.2 Upgrades phased roll out] for more information on the types of updates and upgrade channels.
