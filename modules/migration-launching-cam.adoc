= Launching the CAM web console

You can launch the CAM web console that is installed on the target cluster.

.Procedure

. Log in to the target cluster.
. Obtain the CAM web console URL:
+
----
$ oc get -n openshift-migration route/migration -o go-template='(?i}//{{ .spec.host }}(:|\z){{ println }}' | sed 's,\.,\\.,g'
----

. Launch a browser and navigate to the CAM web console.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you try to access the CAM web console immediately after installing the CAM Operator, the console may not load because the Operator is still configuring the cluster and enabling cross-origin resource sharing. Wait a few minutes and retry.
====

. If you are using self-signed CA certificates, you will be prompted to accept the CA certificate of the source cluster's API server. The web page will guide you through the process of accepting the remaining certificates.

. Log in with your {product-title} *username* and *password*.
