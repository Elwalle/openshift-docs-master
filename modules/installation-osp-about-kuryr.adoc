= About Kuryr SDN

link:https://docs.openstack.org/kuryr-kubernetes/latest/[Kuryr] is a container
network interface (CNI) plug-in solution that uses
link:https://docs.openstack.org/neutron/latest/[OpenStack Neutron] and
link:https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/latest/[OpenStack Octavia] to provide
networking for Pods and Services.

Kuryr and {product-title} integration is primarily designed for
{product-title} clusters running on OpenStack VMs. Kuryr improves the
network performance by plugging OpenShift Pods into OpenStack SDN.
In addition, it provides interconnectivity between OpenShift Pods and
OpenStack virtual instances.

Kuryr components are installed as Pods in {product-title} using the
`openshift-kuryr` namespace:

* `kuryr-controller` - a single Service instance installed on a `master` node.
This is modeled in {product-title} as a `Deployment`.
* `kuryr-cni` - a container installing and configuring Kuryr as a CNI driver on
each {product-title} node. This is modeled in {product-title} as a `DaemonSet`.

The Kuryr controller watches the OpenShift API server for Pod, Service, and
namespace create, update, and delete events. It maps the {product-title} API
calls to corresponding objects in Neutron and Octavia. This means that every
network solution that implements the Neutron trunk port functionality can be
used to back {product-title} via Kuryr. This includes open source solutions
such as Open vSwitch (OVS) and Open Virtual Network (OVN) as well as
Neutron-compatible commercial SDNs.

Kuryr is recommended for OpenShift deployments on encapsulated OpenStack tenant
networks to avoid double encapsulation, such as running an encapsulated
OpenShift SDN over an OpenStack network.

Conversely, Kuryr is not recommended in the following cases:

* You use provider networks or tenant VLANs.
* Your deployment uses many Services on a few hypervisors. Each OpenShift
  Service creates an Octavia Amphora virtual machine in OpenStack that hosts a
  required load balancer.
* UDP Services are needed.
