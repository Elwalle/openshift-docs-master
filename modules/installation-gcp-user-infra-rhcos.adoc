= Creating the {op-system} cluster image for the GCP infrastructure

You must use a valid {op-system-first} image for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for
your {product-title} nodes.

.Procedure

Hat customer portal or the
link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.2/[{op-system} image mirror]
page.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The {op-system} images might not change with every release of {product-title}.
You must download an image with the highest version that is
less than or equal to the {product-title} version that you install. Use the image version
that matches your {product-title} version if it is available.
====

The file name contains the {product-title} version number in the format
`rhcos-<version>-gcp.tar`.

$ gcloud compute images create "${INFRA_ID}-rhcos-image" \
    --source-uri="${IMAGE_SOURCE}"
