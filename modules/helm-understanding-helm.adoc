= Understanding Helm

Helm is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that simplifies deployment of applications and services to {product-title} clusters. Helm uses a packaging format called charts. A Helm chart is a collection of files that describes {product-title} resources. 

== Key features

Helm provides the ability to:

* Search through a large collection of charts stored in the chart repository.
* Modify existing charts.
* Create your own charts with {product-title} or Kubernetes resources.
* Package and share your applications as charts.
