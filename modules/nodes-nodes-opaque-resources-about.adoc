= Understanding opaque resources

Opaque integer resources are called _opaque_ because {product-title} 
does not know what the resource is, but will schedule a pod on a node 
only if enough of that resource is available. They are called _integer resources_ 
because they must be available, or _advertised_, in integer amounts. The API server
restricts quantities of these resources to whole numbers. Examples of
_valid_ quantities are `3`, `3000m`, and `3Ki`. 

Opaque integer resources can be used to allocate:

* Last-level cache (LLC)
* Graphics processing unit (GPU) devices
* Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices
* Slots for sharing bandwidth to a parallel file system.

For example, if a node has 800 GiB of a special kind of disk storage, you could create a name for the special storage, 
such as `_opaque-int-resource-special-storage_`. You could advertise it in chunks of a certain size, 
such as 100 GiB. In that case, your node would advertise that it has eight resources of type `opaque-int-resource-special-storage`.

Opaque integer resource names must begin with the prefix `pod.alpha.kubernetes.io/opaque-int-resource-`.
