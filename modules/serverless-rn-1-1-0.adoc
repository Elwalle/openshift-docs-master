= Release Notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} Technology Preview 1.1.0

[id="new-features-1-1-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} has been updated to use Knative Serving 0.8.1.
* Enhanced Operator metadata now includes more information regarding support state and a link to the official installation documentation.
* A developer preview version of Knative Eventing is now available for use with {ServerlessProductName}, however this is not included in the {ServerlessProductName} Operator and is not currently supported as part of this Technology Preview. For more information, see https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/index.html[Knative Eventing on OpenShift Container Platform].

[id="fixed-issues-1-1-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Users who were not project administrators would previously see the following error when using {ServerlessProductName}:
+
----
revisions.serving.knative.dev: User "sounds" cannot list resource "revisions
----
+
This issue has now been fixed with the addition of new RBAC rules.

* A race condition was preventing Istio sidecar injection from working correctly. Istio did not consider the `knative-serving` namespace to be present in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll at the time of Pod creation. Istio now waits for status information from ServiceMeshMemberRoll which fixes this issue.

[id="known-issues-1-1-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Users may see the error `Unknown Uninitialized : Waiting for VirtualService to be ready` while waiting for a service in a newly created namespace to be ready, which can take several minutes. If a user allows enough time between the creation of a namespace and the creation of a service in the namespace (approximately one minute), this error may be avoided.

* Existing Knative Services and Routes which have been created with public visibility cannot be updated to cluster-local visibility. If you require cluster-local visibility on Knative Services and Routes, this must be configured at the time of creating these resources.

* Knative service returns a 503 status code when the cluster is running for a
long time. The Knative Serving Pods do not show any errors. Restarting the
`istio-pilot` Pod temporarily fixes the issue.

* gRPC and HTTP2 do not work against routes. This is a known limitation of
OpenShift routes.
