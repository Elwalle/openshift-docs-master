= Adding a master host back to the etcd cluster

Follow these steps to add a master host back to the etcd cluster. This procedure assumes that you previously removed the master host from the cluster and that its etcd dependencies, such as TLS certificates and DNS, are valid.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* SSH access to the master host to add to the etcd cluster.
* The IP address of an existing active etcd member.

.Procedure

. Access the master host to add to the etcd cluster.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must run this procedure on the master host that is being added to the etcd cluster.
====

. Run the `etcd-member-add.sh` script and pass in two parameters:

** the IP address of an existing etcd member
** the name of the etcd member to add
