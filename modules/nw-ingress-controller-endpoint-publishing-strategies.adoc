= Ingress controller endpoint publishing strategy

An Ingress controller with the `HostNetwork` endpoint publishing strategy can have only one Pod replica per node. If you want _n_ replicas, you must use at least _n_ nodes where those replicas can be scheduled. Because each Pod replica requests ports `80` and `443` on the node host where it is scheduled, a replica cannot be scheduled to a node if another Pod on the same node is using those ports.
