= Starting the {tsb-name}

After you have installed the {tsb-name} Operator, you can start the
{tsb-name} using the following procedure.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the service catalog.
* You have installed the {tsb-name} Operator.

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* and select the `openshift-template-service-broker` project.
. Select the *Template Service Broker Operator*.
. Under *Provided APIs*, click *Create New* for *Template Service Broker*.
. Review the default YAML and click *Create*.
. Verify that the {tsb-name} has started.
+
After the {tsb-name} has started, you can view the available
template applications by navigating to *Catalog* -> *Developer Catalog* and
selecting the *Service Class* checkbox. Note that it may take a few minutes for
the {tsb-name} to start and the template applications to be
available.

If you do not yet see these Service classes, you can check the status of the
following items:

* {tsb-name} Pod status
** From the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page for the *openshift-template-service-broker*
project, verify that the Pod that starts with `apiserver-` has a status of
*Running* and readiness of *Ready*.

* Cluster service broker status
** From the *Catalog* -> *Broker Management* -> *Service Brokers* page, verify
that the *template-service-broker* service broker has a status of *Ready*.

* Service catalog controller manager Pod logs
** From the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page for the
*openshift-service-catalog-controller-manager* project, review the logs for
each of the Pods and verify that you see a log entry with the message
`Successfully fetched catalog entries from broker`.
