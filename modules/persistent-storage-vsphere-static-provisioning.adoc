= Statically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes

To statically provision VMware vSphere volumes you must create the virtual machine disks for reference by the persistent volume framework.

.Prerequisites

* Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as a volume in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Create the virtual machine disks. Virtual machine disks (VMDKs) must be created manually before statically provisioning VMware vSphere volumes. Use either of the following methods:

  * Create using `vmkfstools`. Access ESX through Secure Shell (SSH) and then use following command to create a VMDK volume:
+
----
$ vmkfstools -c <size> /vmfs/volumes/DatastoreName/volumes/<disk-name>.vmdk
----

  * Create using `vmware-diskmanager`:
+
----
$ shell vmware-vdiskmanager -c -t 0 -s <size> -a lsilogic <disk-name>.vmdk
----

. Create a PersistentVolume that references the VMDKs. Create a file, `pv.yaml`, with the PersistentVolume object definition:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi <2>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  vsphereVolume: <3>
    volumePath: "[datastore1] volumes/myDisk"  <4>
    fsType: ext4  <5>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This name is how it is identified by PersistentVolumeClaims or Pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> The volume type used, with `vsphereVolume` for vSphere volumes. The label is used to mount a vSphere VMDK volume into pods. The contents of a volume are preserved when it is unmounted. The volume type supports VMFS and VSAN datastore.
<4> The existing VMDK volume to use. You must enclose the datastore name in square brackets, `[]`, in the volume definition, as shown previously.
<5> The file system type to mount. For example, ext4, xfs, or other file-systems.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the fsType parameter after the volume is formatted and provisioned can result in data loss and Pod failure.
====

. Create the PersistentVolume from the file:
+
----
$ oc create -f pv.yaml
