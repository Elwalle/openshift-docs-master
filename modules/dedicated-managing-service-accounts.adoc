= Managing service accounts

Service accounts are API objects that exist within each project. To manage
service accounts, you can use the `oc` command with the `sa` or `serviceaccount`
object type or use the web console.

To get a list of existing service accounts in the current project, run:

----
$ oc get sa
NAME       SECRETS   AGE
builder    2         2d
default    2         2d
deployer   2         2d
----

To create a new service account, run:

----
$ oc create sa <service-account-name>
----

As soon as a service account is created, two secrets are automatically added to
it:

* an API token
* credentials for the OpenShift Container Registry

These can be seen by describing the service account:

----
$ oc describe sa <service-account-name>
----

The system ensures that service accounts always have an API token and registry
credentials.

The generated API token and registry credentials do not expire, but they can be
revoked by deleting the secret. When the secret is deleted, a new one is
automatically generated to take its place.
