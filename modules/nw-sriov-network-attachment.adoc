= Configuring SR-IOV additional network

You can configure an additional network that uses SR-IOV hardware by creating a SriovNetwork Custom Resource (CR).
When you create a SriovNetwork CR, the SR-IOV Operator automatically creates a NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR.

[NOTE]
=====
Do not modify or delete a SriovNetwork Custom Resource (CR) if it is attached to any Pods in the `running` state.
=====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create the following SriovNetwork CR, and then save the YAML in the `<name>-sriov-network.yaml` file. Replace `<name>` with a name for this additional network.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork
metadata:
  name: <name> <1>
  namespace: sriov-network-operator <2>
spec:
  networkNamespace: <target_namespace> <3>
  ipam: |- <4>
    ...
  vlan: <vlan> <5>
  resourceName: <sriov_resource_name> <6>
----
<1> Replace `<name>` with a name for the CR. The Operator will create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR with same name.
<2> Specify the namespace where the SR-IOV Operator is installed.
<3> Replace `<target_namespace>` with the namespace where the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR will be created.
<4> Specify a configuration object for the ipam CNI plug-in as a YAML block scalar. The plug-in manages IP address assignment for the attachment definition.
<5> Replace `<vlan>` with a Virtual LAN (VLAN) ID for the additional network. The integer value must be from `0` to `4095`. The default value is `0`.
<6> Replace `<sriov_resource_name>` with the value for the `.spec.resourceName` parameter from the SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR that defines the SR-IOV hardware for this additional network.

. Create the CR by running the following command:
+
----
$ oc create -f <filename> <1>
----
<1>  Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you created in the previous step.

. Optional: Confirm that the NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR associated with the SriovNetwork CR that you created in the previous step exists by running the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace you specified in the SriovNetwork CR.
+
----
oc get net-attach-def -n <namespace>
