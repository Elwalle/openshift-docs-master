= Manually rotate the service CA certificate

The service CA is valid for one year after {product-title} is
installed. If you have a cluster that has been running
for one year without upgrades, then you must manually
refresh the service CA.

This process is automatically performed during an upgrade.
Follow these steps only if you do not update your cluster.

.Prerequisites

* You must be logged in as a cluster admin.

.Procedure

. View the expiration date of the current service CA certificate by
using the following command.
+
----
$ oc get secrets/signing-key -n openshift-service-ca \
     -o template='{{index .data "tls.crt"}}' \
     | base64 -d \
     | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
----
+
If this certificate expires before a scheduled upgrade, then proceed
through the following steps. Otherwise, there is no need to perform
the rotation at this time.

. Manually rotate the service CA. This process generates a new service CA
which will be used to sign the new service certificates.
+
----
$ oc delete secret/signing-key -n openshift-service-ca
----

. To apply the new certificates to all services, restart all the Pods
in your cluster. This command ensures that all services use the
updated certificates.
+
----
$ for I in $(oc get ns -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]} {.metadata.name}{"\n"} {end}'); \
      do oc delete pods --all -n $I; \
      sleep 1; \
      done
----

[WARNING]
====
This command will cause a service interruption, as it goes through and
deletes every running pod in every namespace. These pods will automatically
restart after they are deleted.
