= Cluster size requirements

The cluster must be sized appropriately to ensure that OpenShift Serverless can run correctly. You can use the MachineSet API to manually scale your cluster up to the desired size.

An OpenShift cluster with 10 CPUs and 40 GB memory is the minimum requirement for getting started with your first serverless application. This usually means you must scale up one of the default MachineSets by two additional machines. 

[NOTE]
====
For this configuration, the requirements depend on the deployed applications. By default, each pod requests ~400m of CPU and recommendations are based on this value. In the given recommendation, an application can scale up to 10 replicas. Lowering the actual CPU request of the application further pushes the boundary.

[NOTE]
====
The numbers given only relate to the pool of worker machines of the OpenShift cluster. Master nodes are not used for general scheduling and are omitted.
====

For more advanced use-cases, such as using OpenShift logging, monitoring, metering, and tracing, you must deploy more resources. Recommended requirements for such use-cases are 24 vCPUs and 96GB of memory.
