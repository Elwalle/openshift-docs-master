toc::[]

This document describes the process to recover from a complete loss of a master host. This includes
situations where a majority of master hosts have been lost, leading to etcd quorum loss and the cluster going offline. This procedure assumes that you have at least one healthy master host.

At a high level, the procedure is to:

. Restore etcd quorum on a remaining master host.
. Create new master hosts.
. Correct DNS and load balancer entries.
. Grow etcd to full membership.

If the majority of master hosts have been lost, you will need an xref:../../backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backing-up-etcd-data_backup-etcd[etcd backup] to restore etcd quorum on the remaining master host.

[NOTE]
====
If you have a majority of your masters still available and have an etcd quorum, then follow the procedure to xref:../../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#replacing-failed-master-host[replace a single failed master host].
