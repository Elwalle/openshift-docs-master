toc::[]

You can migrate application workloads between {product-title} 4.2 clusters with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, enable you to migrate stateful and stateless application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

.Prerequisites

* You must have xref:../../cli_reference/openshift_cli/administrator-cli-commands.html#policy[`cluster-admin` privileges] on all clusters.
* You must configure a replication repository that is accessible to the source and target clusters.

[id='Configuring-replication-repository_{context}']
== Configuring a replication repository

You must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository. The CAM tool copies data from the source cluster to the replication repository, and from there to the target cluster, using either the xref:file-system-copy-method_{context}[file system] or the xref:snapshot-copy-method_{context}[snapshot] data copy method.

The following storage providers are supported:

* Generic S3 storage, with an S3 bucket for migration
* xref:migration-configuring-aws-s3_{context}[AWS S3]
* xref:migration-configuring-gcp_{context}[Google Cloud Provider]
* xref:migration-configuring-azure_{context}[Microsoft Azure]

== Deploying the Cluster Application Migration tool

Deploying the CAM tool involves the following steps:

. Installing the CAM Operator  on the xref:installing-cam-operator-ocp-4_sourcecluster-4_2-4_x[source] and xref:installing-cam-operator-ocp-4_targetcluster-4_2-4_x[target] clusters
. Configuring cross-origin resource sharing on the xref:migration-configuring-cors-4_sourcecluster-4_2-4_x[source cluster]

== Troubleshooting

You can view the migration custom resources (CRs) and download logs to troubleshoot a failed migration.
